  <h4>What to do when I start a timer?</h4>
  <p>that's the beauty of it. you can choose. you could write mindboggling essays, paint incredible art, code the next
    big social media app, learn about human anatomy, perform brain surgery, design a nuclear power plant, etc.</p>
  <h4>What if I use adderall in addition to this chrome extension?</h4>
